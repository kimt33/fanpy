def cma(objective, save_file="", **kwargs):
    """Solve an equation using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy.

    See module `cma` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objective : BaseSchrodinger
        Instance that contains the function that will be optimized.
    save_file : str
        File to which the results of the optimization is saved.
        By default, the results are not saved.
    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments to `cma.fmin`. See its documentation for details.
        By default, 'sigma0' is set to 0.01 and 'options' to `{'ftarget': None, 'timeout': np.inf,
        'tolfun': 1e-11, 'verb_filenameprefix': 'outcmaes', 'verb_log': 0}`.
        The 'sigma0' is the initial standard deviation. The optimum is expected to be within
        `3*sigma0` of the initial guess.
        The 'ftarget' is the termination condition for the function value upper limit.
        The 'timeout' is the termination condition for the time. It is provided in seconds and must
        be provided as a string.
        The 'tolfun' is the termination condition for the change in function value.
        The 'verb_filenameprefix' is the prefix of the logger files that will be written to disk.
        The 'verb_log' is the verbosity of the logger files that will be written to disk. `0` means
        that no logs will be saved.
        See `cma.evolution_strategy.cma_default_options` for more options.

    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary with the following keys and values:
    success : bool
        True if optimization succeeded.
    params : np.ndarray
        Parameters at the end of the optimization.
    energy : float
        Energy after optimization.
        Only available for objectives that are OneSidedEnergy, TwoSidedEnergy, and
        LeastSquaresEquations instances.
    message : str
        Termination reason.
    internal : list
        Returned value of the `cma.fmin`.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If objective is not BaseSchrodinger instance.

        If objective has more than one equation.
