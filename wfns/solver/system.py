    """Solve the system of Schrodinger equations as a least squares problem.

    This function wraps around `scipy.optimize.least_squares`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objective : SystemEquations
        Objective that describes the system of equations.
    save_file : str
        File to which the results of the optimization is saved.
        By default, the results are not saved.
    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments to `scipy.optimize.least_squares`. See its documentation for details.
        By default, 'xtol', 'ftol', and 'gtol' are set to `1e-15`, 'max_nfev' is 1000 times the
        number of active parameters, and `jac` is the Jacobian provided by the objective.
        If Jacobian from the objective is not used, then `3-point` scheme should be used for
        parameters that are floats and `cs` scheme for parameters that are complex.

    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary with the following keys and values:
    success : bool
        True if optimization succeeded.
    params : np.ndarray
        Parameters at the end of the optimization.
    energy : float
        Energy of the system after optimization
    residuals  : np.ndarray
        Value of each equation in the system.
    cost : float
        Least squared sum of the values of each equation in the system.
    message : str
        Message returned by the optimizer.
    internal : OptimizeResults
        Returned value of the `scipy.optimize.least_squares`.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If objective is not SystemEquations instance.
