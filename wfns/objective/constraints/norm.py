    .. math::

        \left< \Psi \middle| \Psi \right> - 1 = 0

    However, this may be difficult to evaluate because :math:`\Psi` contains too many Slater
    determinants. Normalization with respect to a reference wavefunction (intermediate
    normalization) can be used in these cases:

    .. math::

        \left<\Phi \middle| \Psi\right> - 1 = 0

    where :math:`\Phi` is some reference wavefunction.

    Attributes
    ----------
    tmpfile : str
        Name of the file that will store the parameters used by the objective method.
        By default, the parameter values are not stored.
        If a file name is provided, then parameters are stored upon execution of the objective
        method.
    param_selection : ParamMask
        Selection of parameters that will be used in the objective.
        Default selects the wavefunction parameters.
        Any subset of the wavefunction, composite wavefunction, and Hamiltonian parameters can be
        selected.
    wfn : BaseWavefunction
        Wavefunction that defines the state of the system (number of electrons and excited state).
    refwfn : {tuple of int, CIWavefunction}
        Wavefunction against which the Schrodinger equation is integrated.
        Tuple of Slater determinants will be interpreted as a projection space, and the reference
        wavefunction will be the given wavefunction truncated to the given projection space.

    Properties
    ----------
    params : {np.ndarray(K, )}
        Parameters of the objective at the current state.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wfn : BaseWavefunction
            Wavefunction that defines the state of the system (number of electrons and excited
            state).
        refwfn : {tuple/list of int, CIWavefunction, None}
            Wavefunction against which the norm is integrated.
            Tuple of Slater determinants will be interpreted as a projection space, and the
            reference wavefunction will be the given wavefunction truncated to the given projection
            space.
            By default, the given wavefunction is used as the reference by using a complete
            projection space.
        param_selection : {list, tuple, ParamMask, None}
            Selection of parameters that will be used to construct the objective.
            For use as a constraint, the same `param_selection` should be provided as the objective
            instance that will be constrained.
            If list/tuple, then each entry is a 2-tuple of the parameter object and the numpy
            indexing array for the active parameters. See `ParamMask.__init__` for details.
        tmpfile : str
            Name of the file that will store the parameters used by the objective method.
            By default, the parameter values are not stored.
            If a file name is provided, then parameters are stored upon execution of the objective
            method.
