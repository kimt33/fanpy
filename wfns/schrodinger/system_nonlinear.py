        Selection of parameters that will be used in the objective.
        Default selects the wavefunction parameters.

            Value of the Jacobian :math:`J_{ij}`.

        Notes
        -----
        Much of the code is copied from `OneSidedEnergy.objective` to compute the energy. It is not
        called because the norm is still needed for the constraint (meaning that much of the code
        will be copied over anyways), and the derivative of the energy uses some of the the same
        matrices.
