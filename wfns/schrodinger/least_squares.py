    Energy can be a constant, a parameter that gets optimized, or a function of the wavefunction and
    hamiltonian parameters.

        E = \frac{\left< \Phi_{ref} \middle| \hat{H} \middle| \Psi \right>}
                 {\left< \Phi_{ref} \middle| \Psi \right>}

    Additionally, the normalization constraint is added with respect to the reference state.

    Attributes
    ----------
    wfn : BaseWavefunction
        Wavefunction that defines the state of the system (number of electrons and excited state).
    ham : BaseHamiltonian
        Hamiltonian that defines the system under study.
    tmpfile : str
        Name of the file that will store the parameters used by the objective method.
        By default, the parameter values are not stored.
        If a file name is provided, then parameters are stored upon execution of the objective
        method.
    param_selection : ParamMask
        Selection of parameters that will be used in the objective.
        Default selects the wavefunction parameters.
        Any subset of the wavefunction, composite wavefunction, and Hamiltonian parameters can be
        selected.
    pspace : {tuple/list of int, tuple/list of CIWavefunction, None}
        States onto which the Schrodinger equation is projected.
        By default, the largest space is used.
    refwfn : {tuple/list of int, CIWavefunction}
        State with respect to which the energy and the norm are computed.
        If a list/tuple of Slater determinants are given, then the reference state is the given
        wavefunction truncated by the provided Slater determinants.
        Default is ground state HF.
    eqn_weights : np.ndarray
        Weights of each equation.
        By default, all equations are given weight of 1 except for the normalization constraint,
        which is weighed by the number of equations.
    energy : ParamContainer
        Energy used in the Schrodinger equation.
        Used to store/cache the energy.
    energy_type : {'fixed', 'variable', 'compute'}
        Type of the energy used in the Schrodinger equation.
        If 'fixed', the energy of the Schrodinger equation is fixed at the given value.
        If 'variable', the energy of the Schrodinger equation is optimized as a parameter.
        If 'compute', the energy of the Schrodinger equation is computed on-the-fly with respect to
        the reference.
