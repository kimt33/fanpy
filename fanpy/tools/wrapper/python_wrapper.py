"""Wraps appropriate Python versions around current Python version (3.6+).

Because HORTON does not support many versions of Python, some sort of workaround is needed. Since
only certain arrays are needed from HORTON, these arrays are extracted and saved to disk as a `.npy`
file. Then, user can load these files to have access to these numbers.

Notes
-----
This is only a temporary solution. We can make things back-compatible to certain versions of HORTON,
or we can wait until these modules catch up to the latest Python versions. For now, this module can
act as a temporary hack to access these modules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calctype : {'horton_hartreefock.py', 'horton_gaussian_fchk.py'}
        Name of the python script to be used.
    energies_name : {str, 'energies.npy}
        Name of the file to be generated that contains the electronic and nuclear-nuclear repulsion
        energy.
        First entry is the electronic energy.
        Second entry is the nuclear-nuclear repulsion energy.
    oneint_name : {str, 'oneint.npy}
        Name of the file to be generated that contains the one electron integrals.
        If two-dimensional matrix, then the orbitals are restricted.
        If three-dimensional matrix, then the orbitals are unrestricted.
    twoint_name : {str, 'twoint.npy}
        Name of the file to be generated that contains the two electron integrals.
        If four-dimensional matrix, then the orbitals are restricted.
        If five-dimensional matrix, then the orbitals are unrestricted.
    remove_npyfiles : bool
        Option to remove generated numpy files.
        True will remove numpy files.
    kwargs
        Keyword arguments for the script.

    Returns
    -------
    el_energy : float
        Electronic energy.
    nuc_nuc_energy : float
        Nuclear-nuclear repulsion energy.
    oneint : {np.ndarray, tuple of np.ndarray}
        One electron integrals.
        If numpy array, then orbitals are restricted.
        If tuple of numpy arrays, then orbitals are unrestricted.
    twoint : {np.ndarray, tuple of np.ndarray}
        Two electron integrals.
        If numpy array, then orbitals are restricted.
        If tuple of numpy arrays, then orbitals are unrestricted.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If calctype is not one of 'horton_hartreefock.py' or 'horton_gaussian_fchk.py'

    Note
    ----
    Since HORTON is available only for Python 2.7, it is not compatible with this module. This
    function executes the given scripts using the Python interpreter that is compatible with HORTOn,
    provided via an environment variable `HORTONPYTHON`. However, this function is a security risk
    since we do not actually check that the file provided by the environment variable is a Python
    interpreter. This means that **it is up to the user to specify the correct path for the Python
    interpreter**.
