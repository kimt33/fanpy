    Parameters
    ----------
    olp(sd, params) : function
        Function that returns the overlap from the given Slater determinant and the wavefunction
        parameters.
        `sd` is an integer whose bitstring describes the occupation of the Slater determinant. See
        `fanpy.tools.slater` for more details.
        `params` is a numpy array that contains the parameters of the wavefunction. If other types
        of parameters is desired, `assign_params` should be provided.
    olp_deriv(sd, params) : function
        Function that returns the derivatives of the overlap with respect to the wavefunction
        parameters from the given Slater determinant and the wavefunction parameters.
        `sd` is an integer whose bitstring describes the occupation of the Slater determinant. See
        `fanpy.tools.slater` for more details.
        `params` is a numpy array that contains the parameters of the wavefunction. If other types
        of parameters is desired, `assign_params` should be provided.
    nelec : int
        Number of electrons in the wavefunction.
    nspin : int
        Number of spin orbitals in the wavefunction.
    params : np.ndarray
        Parameters of the wavefunction.
        If is not a numpy array, then `assign_params` should be provided.
    memory : {float, int, str, None}
        Memory available (in bytes) for the wavefunction.
        If number is provided, it is the number of bytes.
        If string is provided, it should end iwth either "mb" or "gb" to specify the units.
        Default does not limit memory usage (i.e. infinite).
    assign_params(self, params) : function
        Method for assigning the parameters in the wavefunction class. First argument is `self` and
        second argument is `params`.
        Default uses `BaseWavefunction.assign_params`.
